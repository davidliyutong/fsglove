## Introduction
Accurate hand motion capture (MoCap) is critical for robotics, virtual reality, and biomechanics, yet existing systems often fail to capture high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) joint kinematics and personalized hand shapes. FSGlove addresses these limitations with an inertial-based system that tracks up to 48 DoFs and reconstructs hand shapes using DiffHCal, a novel calibration method. Equipped with IMUs on each finger joint and dorsum, FSGlove achieves high-resolution motion sensing. DiffHCal integrates with the MANO model via differentiable optimization, resolving joint kinematics, shape parameters, and sensor misalignment in a single step.

> **Note:** The source code for FSGlove will be open-sourced after the reviewing process.

## Hand Assembly Guide  
TBD. (A video instruction is being filmed.)  

## Hand Server Setup  
### Overview  
The hand server powers the SBC on the FSGlove. It is a standard Golang project that compiles into a single binary and can run on almost any platform. We have tested it on the Raspberry Pi 2W.  

### Build Instructions  
TBD.  

## DiffHCal Setup  
### Overview  
DiffHCal is developed using `manotorch`, which requires a `PyTorch` environment and the presence of the MANO model. To achieve real-time processing, a capable **NVIDIA GPU** (supporting CUDA 11) is recommended.  

Given the complex dependencies of this project, we recommend setting up a virtual environment (e.g., a Conda environment) to avoid conflicts. The project also relies on common build tools such as `Make`.  

### Step-by-Step Setup  
1. Obtain the MANO model from [here](https://mano.is.tue.mpg.de/) and extract it under `assets/mano`. The directory structure should look like this:  
   ```text  
   ./assets/mano  
   ├── LICENSE.txt  
   ├── __init__.py  
   ├── models  
   ├── ...  
   ```  

2. Create a virtual environment using `conda`. The DiffHCal project is built with `python@3.10` syntax (e.g., typing annotations) but will likely work on higher versions.  
   ```shell  
   conda create -n rfmocap python=3.10  
   conda activate rfmocap  
   ```  

3. Install the dependencies from `requirements.txt`. A single `pip install` command should suffice.  
   ```shell  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  
   This will install:  
   - `torch:2.3.0` compiled with `cuda:11.8` runtime.  
   - `numpy:1.22.4` for compatibility reasons.  
   - `manotorch` from the latest GitHub master branch.  
   - `polyscope` for visualization.  
   - `pyrfuniverse`, a binding for [RFUniverse](https://github.com/robotflow-initiative/rfuniverse), used for simulation and tele-operation demo.  
   - `grpcio-tools:1.60.0` and `grpcio==1.60.0` for gRPC communication.  
   - Other utilities.  

   > On some Linux systems, you might encounter a `libdl.so` missing issue with `rfuniverse`, preventing it from loading URDF. In this case:  
   > 1. Install `libdl.so`:  
   >    ```shell  
   >    sudo apt-get install libc6-dev  
   >    ```  
   > 2. Copy a working `libdl.so` to your working directory.  
   > 3. Follow this post to create a soft-link:  
   >    ```shell  
   >    sudo ln -s /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so  
   >    sudo apt install minizip  
   >    ```  

**Optional:** Update the gRPC client. Run the `make task.pb.python` command to update the gRPC client code in `src/api` from the latest `assets/pb/*.proto` files.  
   ```shell  
   $ make task.pb.python  
   ```  
   ```
   ===========> Generating protobuf files for python  
   /opt/conda/envs/test/lib/python3.10/site-packages/grpc_tools/protoc.py:21: DeprecationWarning: pkg_resources is deprecated as an API. See https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/pkg_resources.html  
     import pkg_resources  
   ```  

4. Finally, you can run the DiffHCal GUI:  
   ```shell  
   python -m src  
   ```  

### Basic Configuration  
The DiffHCal GUI automatically detects its default configuration at `$WORKING_DIRECTORY/config.json`. If the file is absent, it will be created and populated with default values.  

### Dorsal Tracker Configuration  
TBD.
