# Anchor Directory

This directory contains anchor-related data files for the hand visualization system.

## Files

- **anchor_weight.txt** - Weight values for anchor points used in the hand model deformation or registration
- **face_vertex_idx.txt** - Indices mapping faces to vertices in the mesh structure
- **merged_vertex_assignment.txt** - Vertex assignment data for merged mesh components

These files are used for anchor-based hand mesh manipulation and vertex correspondence.
