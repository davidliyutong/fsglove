# Object Model Directory

This directory is intended for storing 3D object models used in hand-object interaction visualization and simulation.

## Files

- **__init__.py** - Python package initialization file

## Purpose

This directory serves as a placeholder for 3D models of objects that can be manipulated or interacted with in the hand visualization system. Object models can include everyday items, tools, or other graspable objects for testing and demonstration purposes.

## Supported Formats

Common 3D model formats that can be placed here include:
- OBJ files
- STL files
- PLY files
- URDF files for articulated objects
- Other mesh formats supported by the visualization pipeline
